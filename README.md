OVERVIEW OF TASK:
TASK-1: SIMPLE CALCULATOR
Keywords:
1. Function: Defines the `calculator()` function to encapsulate the code for reuse.
2. Input: The `input()` function is used to take user input for two numbers and the operator.
3. Type Conversion: `float()` is used to convert input strings to floating-point numbers.
4. Conditional Statements: `if`, `elif`, and `else` are used to handle the different operations based on the operator chosen.
5. Arithmetic Operators: The basic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) are applied to perform the corresponding arithmetic operations.
6. Error Handling: A condition is used to prevent division by zero.
7. Output: `print()` is used to display the result of the operation or any error messages.

Objective:
The objective of this code is to create a simple interactive calculator that:
- Accepts two numbers from the user.
- Allows the user to select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- Computes and displays the result of the chosen operation.
- Prevents division by zero and provides an error message if attempted.
